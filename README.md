### Hi there, I'm Luka ðŸ‘‹

I'll consider myself a back-end focused developer, although I know a thing or two about front-end too

I am very open & interested in learning new languages, frameworks & tools that can be used to create and run different apps

Trying not to be limited by any language/framework, so I am focused on understanding project structure & design patterns that can be implemented anywhere :)
